<!--
  TODO: include dmenu/rmenu support
  TODO: rewrite wayland underlying clipboard stack

### Features
  - Blazingly Fast ðŸ”¥
  - Simple and Easy to Use
  - Unifies Clipboard Tooling into One Binary
  - Multiple and Customizable Storage Options
  - Exact Control on How Long your Copies last

### Why

After looking at existing clipboard management tools for wayland,
**NONE of the existing solutions have all the features I wanted in one
easy-to-use tool.**

Second, **Having an all-in-one daemon avoids many of the weird
hacks required by other solutions due to the nature of wayland
and its protocols.**

Due to waylands design, in order for a copy snippet to remain
available, a process that includes that snippet must always be running.
Tools like `wl-clipboard` use dirty hacks to spawn a fork of themselves
to sit and wait in the background so you can paste snippets copied from
the terminal. _Using a unified daemon avoids these problems._

### Installation

```bash
$ make install
```

### Usage

View all available options and commands via the built-in help

```bash

Ensure the Daemon is Running in the Background.
Easy to Include in Your Sway Config For Example.

Copy and Paste via Terminal with Ease


```bash
$ wclipd copy 'hello world!'
$ wclipd paste
```

View a History of Available Snippets. Previews are listed
from most-recent copy to least.

```bash
$ wclipd copy 'hello'
$ wclipd copy 'world!'
$ wclipd list
2.      world!
1.      hello
```

hello
```
